# 🤝 How to Get the Best Out of ChatGPT for algomin-ui Strategy Builder

You’re building a VFX-inspired logic builder — and here’s how to make the most of our collab.

---

## ✅ DOs

### 🧠 1. Think like a user, speak like a TD
- Describe **what you want to do**, not just what to code.
- Tell me your **pain points** or what's not working.

### 🧩 2. Give structure but not a cage
- Use goal-driven language:
  > “Goal: make condition logic visual & modular”
- Give small examples:
  > “If RELIANCE > 2500 and NIFTY < 16000 → trigger”

### 📸 3. Use screenshots and mockups
- Even scribbles help.
- Upload anything visual — screenshots, diagrams, charts.

### 🛠 4. Label phases, scopes, and intentions
- Helps me chunk output:
  > “Phase 1: drag-and-drop nodes”
  > “This sprint: AND/OR logic with visual feedback”

### 💬 5. Ask for clarity ADHD-style
- Phrases that help:
  > “TL;DR this”  
  > “Show as a diagram”  
  > “Give 3 bullet steps”

## 🚫 DON'Ts

### ❌ 1. Don’t over-specify too early
- Let’s explore the design together.
- Just say what you’re aiming for.

### ❌ 2. Don’t censor creative ideas
- Use “What if…” or “Could we…” freely.

### ❌ 3. Don’t treat this like ‘just code’
- You’re creating a **thinking system** — UX + logic.

### ❌ 4. Don’t fear redoing things
- Rewrites are part of the journey.

## 🧠 Collab Formula to Start a Thread

> **[What I want to build]**  
> + **[Why it’s needed]**  
> + **[What I’m stuck on or need help thinking through]**

Example:
> I want a drag-and-drop logic builder  
> because list-based condition builders are hard to read  
> I’m not sure how to visualize nested AND/OR clearly
