# 🚀 Improvements for algomin-ui

This document outlines areas where the `algomin-ui` project follows solid design patterns — and where it could improve to match the robustness of a production-grade frontend architecture like `algomin`.

## ✅ What’s Working Well

### 1. **Component-based Architecture**
- Components are modular, reusable, and isolated.
- Example: `ChartPanel`, `SettingsModal`, `SymbolSelect`.

### 2. **Separation of Concerns**
- Business logic is abstracted into hooks (e.g. `useLiveTicks`).
- UI rendering and logic are cleanly separated.

### 3. **Smart vs. Dumb Components**
- `Dashboard`, `LiveTickPanel` act as smart containers.
- `ChartPanel`, `SymbolSelect` are clean presentational units.

### 4. **Reusable UI Patterns**
- Use of UI elements like `Card`, `Table`, `Input` implies a design system.
- `SymbolSelect` manages its own logic — great use of self-contained component logic.

## 🤏 Areas for Improvement

### ❌ No Central State Management
- Scattered use of `useState` and `useEffect`.
- Consider Zustand, Redux, or Context API for scalable global state.

### ❌ Flat Directory Structure
- All components live in a single-level folder.
- Adopt **feature-based folders** like `features/settings/SettingsModal.tsx`.

### ⚠️ Minimal Custom Hook Abstraction
- Repetitive logic could be abstracted into reusable hooks.
- Example: extract logic in `ConditionBuilder` into a `useConditions` hook.

### ❌ No Form Validation or Schema Enforcement
- Inputs are handled manually without validation.
- Introduce `zod` or `yup` + `react-hook-form` for robust form handling.

## TL;DR for ADHD 🧠
You’ve built a tidy Lego house 🧱 — clean components, minimal fuss. But there’s no blueprint or zoning 😬. Add a brain (state), folders (organization), and guardrails (validation). Want help turning this into a fortress? Let’s go 🛠️
